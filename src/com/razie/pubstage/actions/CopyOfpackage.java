/**
 * The AutoGeek
 * 
 * The AutoGeek loves tinkering with things. He is a bit technical-inclined and can hook up a Home
 * Theatre system by himself.
 * 
 * Tinkering with software, however, is a killer for the AutoGeek. You see, software these days is a
 * lot more idiotic than hardware. When you buy any piece of hardware these days, it has its own
 * buttons and dials, just like any software. It however, has inputs and outputs, unlike most
 * software - so it can be hooked up to other boxes.
 * 
 * So, the AutoGeek, can easily buy an analog 16 band stereo equalizer and insert it between the
 * stereo and the amp. He cannot just get a photo eye reduction program and insert it between the
 * pictures and the screen saver!
 * 
 * You see, software programmers today consider themselves the smartest people on the planet and
 * they tell you how you will use the programs they build and often, what they build for you has
 * nothing to do with what you actually need. They're as out of touch with reality, as politicians
 * are.
 * 
 * Another thing they do is reduce the entire world of possibilities to their own use cases and
 * close the software to do just that. The "open software" group does open their software but only
 * to other experienced programmers which could use their libraries, in some new and fancy
 * programming language.
 * 
 * The AutoGeek is screwed from all sides when it comes to software.
 * 
 * Let's see how software should be built, so the AutoGeek can tinker with it.
 * 
 * The software should have well defined inputs and outputs, in terms of objects and actionables it
 * supports. It should support several protocols to interact with its actionables. The internal
 * functions of the program should also be exposed as actionables, so the AutoGeek can automate them
 * by, say, hooking up a bluetooth PS3 remote and map the red/green buttons to volume up/down in the
 * VLC player.
 * 
 * The VLC player is not a normal piece of software these days. It actually exposes its entire
 * functionality via several interfaces, including telnet and http.
