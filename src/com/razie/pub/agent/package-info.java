/**
 * Light agent framework.
 * 
 * <h1>What is?</h1>
 * <p>
 * Offers a platform to write/plug-in functionality. There are many such platforms but I could not
 * decide on a particular one to use, although for basic service lifecycle, OSGI seems proper.
 * 
 * <p>
 * What is special about these agents is that, while offering a simple platform to plug-in
 * functionality, they will offer advanced services for distributed communication and cooperation,
 * i.e. "onConnectToOtherAgent()".
 * 
 * <p>
 * Agents form groups which cooperate, best example for that being all the devices in the home (2
 * laptops, 1 desktop, 1 multimedia desktop, 2 tablets, 1 PSP, 2 game consoles). That's 9 computing
 * devices, without counting ipods, cell phones and such.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Given that, there's obviously a need to manage certain services on all those, such as "favorites"
 * etc.
 * 
 * STATE: post-concept, changes but not often
 * 
 * <h1>Developer's Guide</h1>
 * 
 * Write your functionality as an AgentService. Then, in the main(), setup an Agent and add your service.
 * 
 * See SampleJavaService.java and associated unit tests.
