/**
 * Simple embeddable socket/http server implementation. It is not a complete web server
 * implementation, but serves most purposes. It is easy to extend/use - just start it up and mount
 * "listeners".
 * 
 * You can use it as a plain socket server (i.e. ftp or something) OR, just mount the LightCmdGET
 * and it becomes an http server with SOA support.
 * 
 * Features:
 * <li>bind java code to URL
 * <li>parse URL into map of values and viceversa
 * <li>handles multithreaded request processing
 * <li>handles simple authentication/authorization
 * 
 * The basic serving logic is in LightCmdGET: it can either serve a file from URL (classpath, disk)
 * or call a SOA method/service.
 * 
 * See examples in ./test See ../lightsoa for the SOA support. See ../assets for SOA asset support.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Testing code is a lot easier when you can start the server inside the test code rather than as a
 * separate process, see the tests for the light server.
