/**
 * Horizontal frameworks - basic functionality in inter-dependent classes i cannot easily pull
 * apart...
 * 
 * When adding features to base/common code, it generally becomes too coupled. Such as a plain action supporting
 * http thus requiring authentication services...which also know about assets which are drawables etc :)
 * 
 * However, the packages here provide functionality we're most likely to need most of the time, so
 * they can be bundled together.
