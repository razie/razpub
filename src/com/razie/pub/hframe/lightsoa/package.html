Light SOA reflected wrapping of method calls

<p>This package intends to eliminate much of the crap one has to
deal with when writing any kind of service accessible remotely. There's
a miriad of protocols today and each has its own quirks.
<p>Just mark a method to be called with the @SoaMethod, listing the
parameter names. Then wrap the object in a binding wrapper and register
that with whatever protocol you need.
<p>Currently, the parms are just Strings, but since they all get
serialized somehow, what's the big deal?
