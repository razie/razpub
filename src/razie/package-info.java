/**
 * Razie's public code
 *
 * <p> The "razie" package concentrates the most useful functionality from the other packages. 
 * The idea is that the concentrated classes here encapsulate the complexities involved in using the actual implementation of the respective functionaliy. Those original classes are available directly, if their more specific functionality is needed.
